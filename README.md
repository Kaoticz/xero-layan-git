### This is September's Rice

Some notes before proceeding :

> Applying this rice will override all your settings. So make sure to create a backup of your system either via Snapper if using it, or TimeShift. Don't worry though, script will attempt to create a backup for you of your ~/.config folder before proceeding. Still better be safe than sorry.
